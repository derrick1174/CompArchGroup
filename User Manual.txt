This project was coded in Java.

To compile, use "javac Main.java Sim.exe"

To execute, the code requires mulitple switches, detailed next.
Sample command line: "Sim.exe -f trace1.txt -s 1024 -b 16 -a 2 -r RR"


-f filename.txt:
	This switch will be followed by the tracefile in a .txt format.
	This file should contain assembly language code saved from an
	example process according to the format specified in the assignment.

-s cacheSizeInKB:
	This switch will accept the total size of the desired cache. It will
	run with any value of at least one. There is not an upper limit, so it
	is possible to make a huge cache that can crash your program. This 
	value is divided by (blockSize * associativityVal) to determine 
	number of sets. 

-b blockSizeInBytes:
	This switch will accept the block size in bytes, from 4 bytes to 32 bytes.

-a associativityValue:
	This switch accepts 1 for Direct Map implementation, 2 for two-way implementation, 
	4 for four-way implementation, or 8 for eight-way implementation.
	Any other values than 1, 2, 4, or 8 will prevent the code from running.

-r replacementString:
	This switch denotes the replacement policy that is desired.
	It can be followed by one of several strings that pick the desired replacement policy.

	-r RR:
	This will cause replacement policy to be Round Robin style.

	-r RND:
	This will cause replacement policy to be Random style.

	-r LRU:
	This will cause replacement policy to be Least Recently Used style.
